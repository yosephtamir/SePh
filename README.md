## Challenge statement
Finding a house or property in Addis Ababa is very difficult, mainly because real estate(house) agents charge more than necessary and secondly because there is no time to go and look for a house for ownself.

To address this shortage, I plan to develop a website that will connect people looking for homes with people who have homes. This is done by people registering on the website and posting about the house. Then the house seekers choose the right one from the listed houses and make an agreement with the person who posted it through a chat room to rent the house they want.
